## Overview / Motivation

Setting up a nextjs app with dependencies and boilerplate can be time consuming. This boilerplate will provide the necessary set up for you. It uses redux for state management, next-redux-wrapper to assist with managing state between the client and server, and redux-toolkit to help write redux logic. A basic counter is implemented to show state management with redux. Basic layout and dynamic links are also implemented.
